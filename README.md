#### OOP-CS
## Assignment #1
	#IDEA:
		For my OOP Assignment, I plan to choose a dataset which visualises various data 
	and statistics for football World Cup from a certain year (undecided). This will investigate data information such
	as the total amount of goals scored for each World Cup, the number of times a continent has been chosen as a 
	host for the World Cup, etc.
	I hope to display this data using a bar chart and also display other stats on the sketch such as average of some data collected
	as well as fun facts about the World cup through animations (if possible) or outside sources for visualisation.

	#FINAL:
		For my assignment, I have created two data visualisations for World Cup statistics in terms of the number of goals scored
		..*Total number of goals scored in each World Cup, 1938-present
		..*Goals scored by all teams in World Cup 2014
		The first visualisation is a line graph in which the user can interact with each point on the graph. Each point will 
	display the year, total number of goals scored, the country that hosted the competiton and the World Cup champion.
		The second visualisation is a bar chart of the goals scored by each team. The user can hover over each bar and data corresponding 
	to this	will be displayed.

		Software used to store data: Microsoft Excel
		Data file type: .csv (comma separated value)
