## Assignment #1
##### IDEA (Nov 9 2015):
For my OOP Assignment, I plan to choose a dataset which visualises various data 
and statistics for football World Cup from a certain year (undecided). This will investigate data information such
as the total amount of goals scored for each World Cup, the number of times a continent has been chosen as a 
host for the World Cup, etc.
I hope to display this data using a bar chart and also display other stats on the sketch such as average of some data collected
***

###### FINAL (Dec 7 2015):
For my assignment, I have created two data visualisations for World Cup statistics in terms of the number of goals scored
- Total number of goals scored in each World Cup, 1938-present
- Goals scored by all teams in World Cup 2014

The first visualisation is a line graph in which the user can interact with each point on the graph. Each point will 
display the year, total number of goals scored, the country that hosted the competiton and the World Cup champion.
The second visualisation is a bar chart of the goals scored by each team. The user can hover over each bar and data corresponding 
to this	will be displayed.
