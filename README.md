#### OOP-CS
For my OOP Assignment, I plan to choose a dataset which visualises various data 
and statistics for the football World Cup from a certain year (undecided). This will investigate data information such
as the total amount of goals scored for each World Cup, the number of times a continent has been chosen as a 
host for the World Cup, etc.
I hope to display this data using a bar chart and also display other stats on the sketch such as average of some data collected
as well as fun facts about the World cup through animations (if possible) or outside sources for visualisation.
